**#ExoQuest**
A visually immersive space exploration demo built with React + Vite
ExoQuest is a sleek, performance-focused space exploration interface crafted using modern frontend technologies. It simulates the experience of journeying through the cosmos â€” with stunning visuals, dynamic animations, and intuitive navigation.

This project is both a creative concept and a technical demonstration of my frontend capabilities. It's fast, responsive, and built with scalability in mind.

##Tech Stack

Vite â€“ Lightning-fast build tool

JavaScript/ES6+ â€“ Clean, modular code

GitHub Pages â€“ For live deployment

##Features

Cosmic destinations with interactive visuals

Fleet showcase with smooth transitions

User reviews and galaxy-themed UI

##Why I Built This
I wanted to create something that not only looked cool but also allowed me to dive into performance optimization and React component design. ExoQuest is a playground to experiment, learn, and push my frontend limits.
